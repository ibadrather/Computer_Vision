## Jupyter Notebook 1
This notebook is about Loading Data in Keras

## Jupyter Notebook 2
This notebook is about Processing Data in Keras

## Jupyter Notebook 3
This notebook contains the following parts:
1. Preparation
2. Train the model
3. Plot 5 Random Images with their predictions
4. Use the second model VGG16 to do the prediction

## Jupyter Notebook 4
In this notebook, we will compare the accuracy of the two CNN models used.

### The results are intriguing!

These notebooks are part of Applied Deep Learning Capstone Project course, which is a part of a Specialisation offered by IBM on edx.org
