    "Great! You've now calculated the radius of curvature for our lane lines. But now we need to stop and think... We've calculated the radius of curvature based on pixel values, so the radius we are reporting is in pixel space, which is not the same as real world space. So we actually need to repeat this calculation after converting our x and y values to real world space.\n",
    "\n",
    "This involves measuring how long and wide the section of lane is that we're projecting in our warped image. We could do this in detail by measuring out the physical lane in the field of view of the camera, but for this project, you can assume that if you're projecting a section of lane similar to the images above, the lane is about 30 meters long and 3.7 meters wide. Or, if you prefer to derive a conversion from pixel space to world space in your own images, compare your images with U.S. regulations that require a minimum lane width of 12 feet or 3.7 meters, and the dashed lane lines are 10 feet or 3 meters long each.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that our camera image has 720 relevant pixels in the y-dimension (remember, our image is perspective-transformed!), and we'll say roughly 700 relevant pixels in the x-dimension (our example of fake generated data above used from 200 pixels on the left to 900 on the right, or 700). Therefore, to convert from pixels to real-world meter measurements, we can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "Define conversions in x and y from pixels space to meters\n",
    "ym_per_pix = 30/720 # meters per pixel in y dimension\n",
    "xm_per_pix = 3.7/700 # meters per pixel in x dimension\n",
    "\n",
    "In the below quiz, you'll use the above conversions in order to adjust your calculation from before to give real-world lane curvature values. Once again, you'll focus on the left_curverad and right_curverad values within the new measure_curvature_real() function; however, you'll also need to adjust how you use np.polyfit() within generate_data() in order for this to work correctly. How do you need to change these to convert to meters?"
